0->A kc (M/s)
A->0 kd (1/s)

Analytical solution
dA/dt=kc-kdA
A(t=0)=0
is
A(t)=kc/kd[ 1-exp(-kd*t) ]

equilibrates after ~5/kd seconds.


Used: 
kc=0.01 M/s
kd= 1000 /s

Because currently the unimolecular reactions are treated as Poisson processes where each decision is performed one-at-a-time, (only 1 or 0 events per specie), there are small errors that can accumulate when 1-exp(-kd*t) is relatively large (i.e. 0.01).
Hence the use of dt=0.5 us.

This would be remedied by treating unimolecular reactions with choosing the number of events for the whole population, allowing the same accuracy at large steps. 


NOTE: Simulations crash if initial copy numbers is 0. hence the addition of the dummy specie, Phos.mol
