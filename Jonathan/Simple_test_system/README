Simple system of just L + K <-> LK -> Lp + K

changed diffusion of pip2 to 10 from 1, because ODE equilibrium was reached much sooner compared to NERDSS

changed rates to be much slower and increased K from 7 to 70 because the plot was very spiky with low copy number


#### 4/19 ######
changed forward rate converter to simply divide by 0.6022

Got agreement, but NERDSS reaches equilibrium 4x faster than ODEs. Diffusion back to 1?
Changed pip diffusion back to 1. Will be done tmo 

#### 4/20 ####
equilibrium agrees, kinetics slightly off
